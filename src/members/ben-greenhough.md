# Interest and expertise in Virtual Sports

When Ben embarked on his PhD in 2019, extended reality technology was just beginning to emerge in the sports industry. Few organizations had embraced this new frontier, and even fewer understood its potential. Many viewed it as a disruption to the traditional methods of football training. For Ben, however, the challenge was an opportunity. He saw the chance to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the technology, identify its optimal applications, and develop best-practice guidelines to help shape its future in the sports world. This forward-thinking approach is what continues to drive his passion for innovation in virtual sports today.
