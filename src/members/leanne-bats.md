# Virtual Sports Research Interest and collaboration requests 

To support the goal of Sport Waikato with evidence-based research, Leanne is interested in the follow topics to study around Virtual sports

1. **Virtual Sports impact on Fundamental Movement Skills** – which are shown to be of most value when learned in early childhood and whether interventions via this medium later in life can have a positive impact. For example,  Virtual Sports' potential for skill development, physiological effects of virtual sports participation, biomechanics and motor learning in virtual environments.
2. **Broad impact of Virtual Sports applications, and in particular on tackling inactivity**, that is, those whom are not currently engaging in any form of physical activity. Deeply explore the effects of virtual sports use on motivation and participation.
3. **The impact on the sports industry**, and in particular the privatisation of sports. With the likely rise of Virtual Sports, will this virtual variant/discipline of sport cause a privatisation of the sports sector where some virtual sport disciplines become owned by a handful of commercial companies that prevent it being a public good? If so, how could we prevent this to maintain sport-for-all?
4. **The verification, efficacy and positive impact of Virtual Sports and exergame titles** - Is there a role for a leading authority on this (like a health stamp on food or a rating on a film), via robust studies on game titles. Who should it be and what should these labels take into account?

# Research Collaboration with Sport Waikato 
Leanne is happy to explore research with universities on the aforementioned topics (and beyond), where Sport Waikato can offer access to a real world environment, to put theories into the wild :woman_scientist:.
