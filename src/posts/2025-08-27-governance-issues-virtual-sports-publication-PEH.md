Virtual sports are increasingly developed into competitive sporting disciplines. For example, the UCI organises an [UCI Cycling Esports World Championship](https://www.uci.org/competition-hub/2025-uci-cycling-esports-world-championships/7yaBDFMwGaC5IMoH0tUAeh) while World Triathlon partners with SuperTri to host an [E World Triathlon Championship](https://triathlon.org/e-world-triathlon-championship). 

As these sports take place in hybrid environment, i.e. physical performances are translated into virtual platforms or games, new challenges from both sports and esports arise. The recently published study '["There are a lot of vulnerabilities still left": Governance Issues in Virtual Sports](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peh.2025.100360)', part of the special issue [Integrity, Health and Governance Issues in Esports and Virtual Sports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22112669/vsi/107J7HTLKCW) in [Performance Enhancement & Health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/performance-enhancement-and-health), dives into the governance issues that exists in competitive virtual sports (esports) anno 2024-2025.

Methodologically, we interviewed 16 key stakeholders in virtual cycling and virtual triathlon which mainly comprised international Sport governing bodies (e.g. IOC), elite athletes, virtual platform developers, and esports content creators.

# Four governance issues in contemporary (competitive) virtual sports

Our qualitative collective analysis yielded insights into four types of governance issues
1. doping
2. platform fragmentation and commercial interests
3. transparency and open criteria 
4. commitment and decision-making

## Doping
Doping is an issue that long plagued sports, which is unfortunately also the case for virtual sports. In fact, virtual sports gives presents even bigger challenges as includes both the risk of (1) performance enhancing substances and (2) mechanical doping through software and hardware, all while competitions are happing from players' home with no real way to control that.

> The one stereotypical way of the cheating is the doping and the EPO because there is no real way to control that from home (...) One thing all the elite people would like to see is more anti-doping (Manny).
