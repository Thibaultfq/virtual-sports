# Who is Chris?

Semi-retired after more than 20 years as the owner and director of a private Orthopedic Physical Therapy practice located in New York, Chris now enjoys the freedom to dedicate himself to his passions—cycling esports and journalism. 

Chris' position as **the only independent cycling esports journalist** shines through in his writing, featured in prominent publications like [Cycling Weekly](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/author/christopher-schwenker), [Cycling News](https://www.cyclingnews.com/author/christopher-schwenker/), [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/contributor/christopher-schwenker), [Zwift Insider](https://zwiftinsider.com/author/cschwenker/), [Endurance.biz](https://endurance.biz/author/christopher-schwenker/), and [Bicycling](https://www.bicycling.com/). He has interviewed the most influential individuals in the sport, including UCI president and IOC Esports Chairman David Lappartient, UCI Cycling Esports Head Michael Rogers, USA Cycling’s Head of Performance Jim Miller, DCU’s Esports Director Martin Hjørngaard, multiple virtual cycling platform competition directors, and countless elite athletes. In 2024, he was on-site in Abu Dhabi, covering the first live, in-person [2024 UCI Cycling Esports World Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zietwjnKx_4).

[TheZommunique.com](https://www.thezommunique.com), which he created in June 2021, holds the distinction as the only site dedicated to **exploring the emerging discipline of cycling esports**. More than 300,000 athletes, enthusiasts, virtual cycling platforms, and sport governing bodies have utilized the site's over 800 news and op/ed articles and in-depth reporting as a trusted resource since its inception.

Chris co-hosts [The Virtual Velo Podcast](https://thezommunique.com/the-virtual-velo-podcast-p-b-thezommunique-com/) with cycling commentator [Prof. Emma Martin](https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-profiles/emma-martin). Together, they engage with influential figures from the cycling esports community to discuss and debate the sport’s future, including the UCI Esports Coordinator Jacob Fraser, national governing bodies, virtual cycling platform leaders, and multiple world champions, offering a platform for impactful conversations that drive the trajectory of the developing discipline.
