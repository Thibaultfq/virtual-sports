# Thomas' background
Thomas Ross Griffin's background is in culture studies and postcolonial literature. He uses the many critical frameworks found in these overlapping fields of study to analyse the relationship between sport, geopolitics, and culture in the Gulf in his research. Ross has published on a variety of issues within this context, including work on Qatar national sporting identity, gender in Qatar sport, and more recently, the countryâ€™s soft power ambitions as demonstrated by the purchase of Paris Saint-Germain football club and the 2022 World Cup. He is currently the Middle East editor for The [International Journal of the History of Sport](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/fhsp20).

# Interest in virtual sports
Ross is also a keen cyclist and it is through his passion for the sport that he was introduced to virtual sports in 2020. His main interests in eSports lie in further exploring the **ontology of virtual sports** and he has written a chapter on this subject in **The Geopolitical Economy of Esports**, a Routledge edited collection that will be published in early 2026. 

Ross is also interested in investigating **how virtual sports challenge and/or propagate western sporting hegemonies** as well as adding to the discussion of the geopolitics of eSports.

Ross is open to collaboration requests from scholars or journalists looking to work in any of these areas.
