Since 2022, the [Esports, Gaming, and Meta-Sports track](https://ecis2026.it/track-descriptions/esports-gaming-and-meta-sports/) at the European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS) has developed into a key platform for research on sports digitalisation. Initially focused on esports and gaming, the track now also addresses meta-sports, virtual sports and mixed-reality sports (choose whichever name you like most :wink:), reflecting the growing research on the integration of physical activity and digital environments.

For ECIS 2026 in Milan, the track is featured again and chaired by some members of the Virtual Sports Research Network, including [Daniel Westmattelmann](/members/daniel-westmattelmann/) and [Willem Standaert](/members/willem-standaert/). The third track chair is Xiao Xiao. All track chairs have recently contributed extensively to the field of sport digitalisation and virtual sports. In a recent blogpost for example, a new study by Daniel and colleagues on the [Input-Output Principle in Virtual Sports](/2025/05/12/the-input-output-principle-of-virtual-sports/) got discussed.

# Track Scope
The track invites research on esports, gaming, and meta-sports, with a particular interest in sports where physical performance is combined with digital technologies. Relevant topics related to virtual sports include (but are not limited to):

- Institutionalisation of virtual sports and their social and economic impact (e.g. the Olympic Esports Games in 2027)
- Mixed-Reality Sports Platforms (e.g., Zwift, skiing simulators): governance, ethics, business model innovation, ...
- Gamification and Engagement in virtual environments
- Technological Innovations such as VR-based training or AI-driven coaching
- Ethics and Governance in virtual competitions, including fairness and data privacy
- Measuring performance metrics in virtual sports (e.g. see [Input-Output Principle in Virtual Sports](/2025/05/12/the-input-output-principle-of-virtual-sports/))

The track encourages both theoretical and empirical contributions that advance our understanding of these emerging phenomena. Please review the [full track description on the ECIS 2026 website](https://ecis2026.it/track-descriptions/esports-gaming-and-meta-sports/) carefully as it of course encompasses more than only virtual sports.
