# Why the interest in virtual sports?

For a long time, technology in sports has primarily been used to measure and improve athletic performance in the real world. Virtual sports platforms, or meta-sports platforms, now allow athletes to not only measure their physical achievements but also transfer them into a virtual world where they can compete against each other remotely and in real time. In some sports, the institutionalization has advanced to the point where virtual competitions are recognized as standalone disciplines, as seen in cycling. This development offers significant opportunities for sports development, inclusion, and sustainability, but also presents new challenges for sports organizations.

Since fairness is a core value in sports, it is crucial to implement measures that ensure fair competitions in the virtual realm. The high data transparency on virtual sports platforms, such as Zwift, allows for real-time tracking of various performance parameters, determining their impact on competition outcomes, and identifying unusual patterns. Sports federations must develop regulations based on this transparency to ensure the integrity of sports.

Additionally, anti-doping efforts must adapt to this new form of sports. In a project funded by the [Partnership for Clean Competition](https://cleancompetition.org/), I am investigating the use of remote sampling systems to conduct anti-doping controls independently of location.

The rapid development of virtual sports creates an exhilarating frontier, offering many possibilities and redefining the future of athletic competition. Now is the perfect time to immerse yourself in the world of virtual sports and be part of this groundbreaking evolution.
