# Why I founded this website
Hello everyone, my name is Thibault Fouquaert. I am the founder of the Virtual Sports Network and the developer of this science communication and blogging website. If you're new to the term 'Virtual Sports', you can read all about it on the [homepage](/) and on the [About page](/about).

I founded this website because of multiple reasons. First, my PhD research is centered around Virtual Sport. Second, I find it very important as a social scientist to communicate about the research we carry out. Everyone should be able to understand what we do and why it matters. Last, it became apparent to me that there was no channek out there that shared (academic) insights into this topic. Even more, I want to get other people to get involved in this science communcation as well . I believe together, we can grow the Virtual Sports Network where we can connect, share our expertise and build an archive of how interactive and immersive sports technology - such as virtual sports - is evolving and impacting the sports sector.

# Who is Thibault
I am a PhD researcher who is affiliated to the [sport management group of Ghent University](https://www.sportmanagementugent.com). I have a diverse background with a Bachelor in Applied Computer Science, a Master in Communication Science (specialisation New Media & Society), and a master in Business Economics. In my spare time I am passionate about sports and specifically triathlon, which is how I ended up applying for a PhD in Sport Management. Please feel free to contact me to discuss anything on the topics of innovation, sports and science communication. You're more than welcome!
