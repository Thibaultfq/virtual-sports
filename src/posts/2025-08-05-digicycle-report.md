Can virtual sports effectively increase engagement in traditional disciplines? In a world where digital technologies increasingly shape everyday life, an important question arises: how can they be utilized to promote physical activity?

The "[DigiCycle](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20349.17127/1) (Digital innovation in cycling) - Gaming as a tool for enhancing sport participation" project addresses **how gaming platforms like Zwift can support the development of cycling**.

DigiCycle, funded under the Erasmus+ program, aimed not only to analyse the impact of digital sports on physical activity but also to develop a practical model for implementing digital tools within sports federations.

## DigiCycle – How Technology is Transforming Cycling
DigiCycle was initiated in response to the growing interest in digital tools in sports. An increasing number of athletes and amateurs use platforms like Zwift, MyWhoosh, or TrainingPeaks Virtual, which enable virtual training, competition, and social interaction. The project focused on analysing:

*   What factors **motivate** cyclists to use virtual cycling platforms?
*   How can sports federations effectively **implement** digital technologies?
*   What are the main **barriers** to adopting these solutions at national and international levels?

The project brought together experts from various sports organisations, including the [Polish Cycling Foundation](https://www.fundacjakolarska.pl/), the [Danish Cycling Federation](https://www.cyklingdanmark.dk/), the [German Cycling Federation,](https://www.bdr-medienservice.de/) the [Spanish Cycling Federation](https://rfec.com/index.php/es/smartweb/seccion/seccion/rfec/home) and the [European Cycling Union](https://www.uec.ch/). The research findings have led to specific **recommendations** for cycling federations and clubs.


## DigiCycle Research Report

The DigiCycle research surveyed 515 Zwift users, combining survey data with in-app analytics. The findings revealed that:

*   83.1% of respondents were **male**, with an average age of 40.14 years.
*   The average Zwift user level was 23.35 ([out of 100](https://zwiftinsider.com/points-levels-unlocks/)), indicating a high level of **engagement**.
*   79% of respondents reported an improvement in their **performance** due to regular training on the platform.
*   Zwift was perceived as **more motivating** than traditional training, primarily due to competition and gamification elements.


## Key findings

The DigiCycle report provided valuable insights into the digital transformation of cycling. The most significant conclusions include:

1.  **Technology as a Tool for Increasing Activity** – Users of virtual cycling platforms like Zwift tend to engage in physical activity more frequently. This phenomenon is largely driven by gamification, competition, and the ease of accessing workouts anywhere, anytime.
2.  **Motivational Factors for Users** – The study identified key motivations such as expected improvement in athletic performance, entertainment value, and the social aspect of virtual cycling platforms. The latter, particularly the ability to participate in group races and interact with other users, plays a crucial role in sustaining engagement.
3.  **Technological Challenges and Barriers to Adoption** – Despite its benefits, the implementation of digital tools faces several obstacles. The most commonly identified issues include:
    * High equipment costs (smart trainers, virtual cycling platform subscriptions)
    * Lack of standardized implementation strategies among sports federations
    * Limited awareness among coaches and sports managers
4.  **Recommendations for Cycling Federations** – The report provides specific guidelines for incorporating virtual cycling platforms into national sports federations. These include developing training programs for coaches, launching promotional initiatives, and integrating digital solutions with traditional training models.

## What did survey participants say about Zwift?

The Digicycle research also captured the opinion of those who started using virtual cycling platforms, further confirming the results of our quantitative results. Some exemplary findings include:

> Zwift allows me to train regardless of weather conditions and keeps me motivated for regular workouts. Traditionally, I struggle with consistency, but virtual races change my approach to training.

> When I started using Zwift, I didn’t expect how much it would impact my performance. I see a difference not only in my riding times but also in my overall endurance.

## Practical Resources: Massive Open Online Course and Handbook

One of the key outcomes of the DigiCycle project is the development of a **Massive Open Online Course** (MOOC) and a **Handbook**, which serve as guides for sports organizations and coaches looking to implement digital innovations. These materials provide practical insights into:

*   Integrating Zwift and other virtual cycling platforms into training processes
*   Organizing virtual races and events
*   Case studies and best practices from national federations

## The Future of Digital Cycling

The findings from the DigiCycle project indicate that digital innovations hold significant potential for promoting sports and physical activity. However, their successful implementation requires collaboration among sports organizations, technology developers, and athletes themselves.

Technology in sports will not replace traditional competition formats, but it can serve as a valuable complement. **The key question remains: how open will sports federations be to this transformation?** The coming years will reveal the direction digital cycling will take.
